# Project Summaries / Cards

## interactive-portfolio-3d-tree
Title: Interactive Portfolio with 3D Tree Scene
CardSummary: Built a React + Three.js portfolio with an interactive forest hero and production-ready deployment flow.
Focus: Frontend architecture, 3D interaction design, performance-minded implementation.
Impact: Turned the portfolio itself into evidence of engineering ownership and product execution.

## pytorch-bird-images-classifier
Title: PyTorch Bird Images Classifier
CardSummary: Trained a reproducible 200-class bird image baseline and exported artifacts for multimodal reuse.
Focus: Transfer learning workflow, deterministic data prep, artifact reliability.
Impact: Reached 55.19% validation accuracy in a short baseline cycle and enabled downstream fusion work.

## birdsong-audio-baseline
Title: Birdsong Audio Baseline
CardSummary: Created an interpretable audio-only benchmark using scaled features and logistic regression.
Focus: Fast retraining, transparent model behavior, integration-ready outputs.
Impact: Achieved 97.82% test accuracy and stabilized the audio side of multimodal integration.

## multimodal-bird-id-fusion
Title: Multimodal Bird ID (Audio + Image Fusion)
CardSummary: Fused image and audio top-k predictions into a single decision path without expensive retraining.
Focus: Model-output integration, label mapping, deterministic recommendation logic.
Impact: Reduced integration friction and improved prediction usability for real workflows.
