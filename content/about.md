# About

I'm Sara McGhee, a Full-Stack Engineer and creative technologist focused on building systems that are clear, fast, and maintainable.

I build end-to-end products across frontend, backend, and ML-adjacent workflows. My approach starts with constraints: define the failure modes, choose the lightest architecture that meets the goal, and ship in small iterations that keep risk low.

Recent projects include fine-grained bird classification across image and audio pipelines, multimodal recommendation logic, and an interactive 3D portfolio built with React and Three.js. Across each project, I focus on practical decisions, reusable outputs, and clear implementation tradeoffs.

Right now, I'm transitioning deeper into AI/ML by building practical, production-minded systems that connect models to real user workflows.

I also bring a strong creative lens to engineering work. I care about visual storytelling, interaction design, and interfaces that make technical systems easier to trust.
