## Professional background
I am a Senior Full-Stack Engineer with end-to-end ownership across product architecture, implementation, and delivery. I focus on clear system design, pragmatic technical decisions, and shipping maintainable software under real constraints.

## Current focus (AI/ML direction)
I am transitioning deeper into AI/ML by building practical model-powered features tied to real workflows. Recent work includes image classification, birdsong audio baselines, and multimodal fusion logic that combines model outputs into a single, usable recommendation path.

## Technical strengths
- Translating ambiguous product goals into scoped technical plans
- Building reliable React-based interfaces with performance-aware implementation
- Designing reusable model-to-application integration layers
- Producing inspectable, testable outputs that support iterative improvement

## Personal/creative element
I bring a creative technologist mindset to engineering work. I care about visual clarity, interaction quality, and experiences that make complex systems feel understandable and credible.
