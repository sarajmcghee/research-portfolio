# About

I'm Sara McGhee, an ML and frontend builder focused on systems that are clear, fast, and maintainable.

I work from constraints first. I define the failure modes, choose the lightest architecture that meets the goal, and keep outputs reusable so each iteration compounds. That means clean training and evaluation loops, explicit artifact handoffs, and interfaces that make model behavior visible instead of opaque.

Recent work includes fine-grained bird classification across image and audio pipelines, plus an interactive 3D portfolio experience built with React and Three.js. Across both, the throughline is the same: practical decisions, measurable progress, and ownership from prototype to production deploy.

I'm targeting roles where I can own end-to-end delivery across model and product surfaces: Applied AI Engineer, ML Engineer, or product-minded Software Engineer.
