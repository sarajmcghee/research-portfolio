Title: Interactive Portfolio with 3D Tree Scene
Summary: Built a React + Three.js portfolio experience that combines interactive 3D rendering with clear case-study storytelling.
Role: Solo engineer and designer across architecture, 3D interaction, implementation, and deployment.
Tech: React, Vite, Three.js, Florasynth, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions.
Problem: Static portfolio layouts were not effectively communicating technical depth or product ownership.
Approach: Built a production-style single-page system with an interactive forest hero, constrained controls, and structured content sections to balance visual impact with readability.
TechnicalHighlights:
- Implemented a 30-tree scene layout with jittered placement and scale variation.
- Added keyboard, pointer, scroll, and touch joystick support for desktop and mobile interaction.
- Used bounded camera behavior and controlled render constraints to improve usability and stability.
- Configured GitHub Pages deployment with Vite base-path support for reliable publishing.
Impact:
- Improved first-impression engagement while keeping project content scannable.
- Demonstrated full-stack ownership from UX direction to deployment operations.
- Established a reusable portfolio foundation for future case studies.
NextSteps:
- Lazy-load heavier 3D dependencies after first content paint.
- Split larger UI logic into smaller components for maintainability.
- Add CI performance checks to prevent regressions.
